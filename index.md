      This page implements a personal résumé using a design inspired by
      Samsung’s One UI guidelines. The structure emphasises clear
      separation between the viewing area (the header) and the
      interaction area (the main content) as described in Samsung’s
      basic layout guidelines【599480136451797†L194-L211】. Wide margins and
      comfortable spacing ensure content remains readable and easy to
      navigate【599480136451797†L205-L208】. A fixed bottom navigation bar
      mirrors the reachability considerations of One UI while
      providing quick access to different sections of the CV.

        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am a builder of clarity. For more than 15 years I’ve been
          helping organisations find rhythm in the way they plan,
          prioritise and deliver. My career has taken me from the shop
          floor of operations through major national transformation
          programmes to global leadership of delivery and strategy. Along
          the way I’ve learned that successful change is less about
          control and more about creating the right conditions: clear
          roles, shared rituals and the courage to face challenges
          together.
